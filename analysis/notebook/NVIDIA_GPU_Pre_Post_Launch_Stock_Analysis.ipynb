        "\n",
        "- **RTX 30**: Positive performance â€” triggered a very positive reposnse, causes might be linked to pandemic, higher GPU demands by crypto miners, limited initial volume created a artificial scarcity, gaming in general also saw a rise.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **RTX 20**: Dipped before launch, recovered after â€” Nvidia saw initial overestimation of Gtx series and RTX wasnt well recieved at first but later on after games introduced ray tracing, it became a long term bet and inventory issues were also resolved."
